# Shim for CTRE Smart Motor Controllers to act like WPILib-native objects

This repository contains various shims around CTRE's motor controllers that are designed to allow for *as close to possible*, drop in replacements within WPILib examples / documentation code.
Where possible, these shims incorporate sane units.
